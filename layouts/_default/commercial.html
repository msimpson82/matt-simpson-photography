        <p class="sp-split-text">I understand the deliverables because I've worked alongside <strong>marketing teams and ad agencies.</strong> I know what a creative director needs. I know what a business owner needs for their website. And I know the difference between a photo that looks good on a screen and a photo that actually drives results.</p>
