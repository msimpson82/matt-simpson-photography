Sheldon just stepped into a new role at the bank and needed headshots to match. New position, new energy — time for a fresh look on LinkedIn.

He showed up to the studio in a shark blue sports coat and brought the kind of energy that makes my job easy. The guy has presence, and it came through the second he walked in.

We kept it simple…natural light, clean background, no bright lights. The Germantown studio does the heavy lifting when it comes to light, and for a session like this, that's all you need. The goal was a portrait that felt authentic and showcased his personality. Something that looked like Sheldon, not a stock photo of a banker.

The result is a headshot that's striking without trying too hard. It's confident, approachable, and it tells you something about the person behind it…which is exactly what a good LinkedIn photo should do.

If you're starting a new role, getting promoted, or just realized your current headshot is from 2017 — let's fix that. Book a session and walk out with something you're actually proud to post.
