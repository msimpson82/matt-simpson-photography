## The Shoot

I worked with The Perfumery to photograph their factory and highlight the hands on process behind their essential oils. The focus was on the lab, where real scientists were mixing and testing every batch. My job was to capture that detail and precision for their website and international print campaigns. It was a great shoot, and yeah, I came home smelling pretty amazing.

## The Results

This 6 hour shoot netted The Perfumery with over 100 photos for use in their digital and print marketing campaigns!
