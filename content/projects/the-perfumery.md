## The Shoot

Cheers! Tailspin Ale Fest features over 50 breweries from across America with a dedicated section of brews from the bluegrass state of Kentucky. They do a great job with their marketing and needed high quality photos to really kick their online presence in high gear. 

## The Results

This 6 hour shoot netted Tailspin an online portfolio of over 300 photos of the event! I can't wait to do it again next year.
