## The Shoot

Current812 is a luxury apartment community in Jeffersonville, Indiana. They needed brand photography that captured the lifestyle and feel of the property — interiors, amenities, exteriors, and the kind of imagery that makes people want to live there.

## The Results

A full set of interior, exterior, and lifestyle images now used across Current812's website, social media, and leasing materials. Clean, elevated photography that matches the quality of the property itself---

Cheers! Tailspin Ale Fest features over 50 breweries from across America with a dedicated section of brews from the bluegrass state of Kentucky. They do a great job with their marketing and needed high quality photos to really kick their online presence in high gear. 

## The Results

This 6 hour shoot netted Tailspin an online portfolio of over 300 photos of the event! I can't wait to do it again next year.
