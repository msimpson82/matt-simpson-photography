## The Shoot

Storyfest Louisville is HOPE IN ACTION. Created by The Tommy Elliott Fund, a registered 501(c)(3), this entity was formed after a mass shooting in Louisville on April 10, 2023. This tragedy was a pivotal moment for the community, and something which was close to my heart. I was actually on Main St., a block away from the shooting, and it affected me deeply. When Storyfest reached out for photography coverage of their second storytelling event, I knew I had to be a part of it and donated my time to the cause.

The main challenges included:

- **Varied lighting conditions** - From spotlit stages to dimly lit audience areas
- **Capturing emotion** - Both performer passion and audience reactions  
- **Maintaining atmosphere** - Working quietly to preserve the storytelling magic

## The Results

This 4 hour shoot netted Storyfest Louisville a collection of over 300 images to use in their online marketing and branding efforts. It was a real pleasure to serve my commmunity, and my heart is forever with those affected by the shooting at Old National Bank.
