## The Assignment

When Storyfest Louisville approached me to document their premier narrative festival, I knew this would be a unique challenge. This wasn't just about capturing speakers on stage—it was about preserving the magic of storytelling itself.

## My Approach

I focused on three key elements: the storytellers in their moments of vulnerability and power, the audience's emotional responses, and the intimate atmosphere that makes Storyfest special. Using available light and fast glass, I captured the raw energy without disrupting the performances.

## What I Delivered

- 200+ edited images from the full weekend
- Real-time social media content during the event
- Speaker portraits for future marketing materials
- Behind-the-scenes documentation for internal use
- High-resolution gallery for website and press use

## The Result

The client received a comprehensive visual story of their event that captured both the polished performances and the authentic human moments that make Storyfest Louisville a cornerstone of the city's cultural scene.

*"Matt's images perfectly captured the heart of what we do—bringing people together through the power of story."* — Event Director
